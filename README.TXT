Coffee Project is the extra credit assignment. Main class (the driver)
of the program is named BestCoffeeMaker, and it uses pre-defined 
classes to print main menu and give options to the user.

Program is divided into main menu categories - setting up the machine
for first time use (MachineSetup), ordering beverage from a shop (Order),
brewing tea (Tea) or coffee (Coffee). I could have split the topics 
in many different ways (all ingredients as a class) but I found it easiest
to split by topic. Biggest reason why was that tea and coffee are
very different drinks with different temperatures, different additives
(one would not put lemon in coffee I think), different types of base 
(one type of coffee grounds and many types of tea leaves). Tea is very 
sensitive to temperature, whereas coffee can be set at basically any;
that is why I programmed the machine to set water temperature for the 
optimal enjoyment.

The program uses file IO and keyboard input. 

Information on tea and coffee stats is from the Internet.

Although the assignment asked for a GUI, we have not studied this in
class and I did not have time to learn JFrame fast enough to fully
implement graphics. I prioritized implementing what I knew from before.
It is also the first time I am describing a program so not sure what
else should go here.
